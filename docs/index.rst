Iago
----

Iago is a load generation tool. If you want to know how well your service handles a heavy load, try Iago on it.

Unlike many other load-test tools, Iago lets you specify a rate of requests and has program hooks to let you write complex request behavior. See `Iago's philosophy <http://twitter.github.com/iago/philosophy.html>`__ for more info about picking between Iago and other load-generation tools.

If you have questions about these docs or using Iago, visit the `open source users' list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iago-users>`__.
